Hi, thanks for download this pack asset!


HOW TO IMPORT THE PACKAGE ON GODOT:

1) open the zip file
2) create a new project (or use your main project, but make a backup before)
3) export the zip content to your project
4) restart Godot

you'll find a new node called "escenario" with a child node called "tilemap". Here you can add or remove it (that's all for a demo purpose)

ANY DOUBTS feel free to comment in my itch.io page!
